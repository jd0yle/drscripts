### This script is an automap plugin fix for the stat trainer rooms in Crossing.
### These rooms do not have the full xml feed that other rooms do,
### so the room variables do not populate and the automapper
### thinks it is still in the room you entered from.
### This script is called for all arcs in the connecting room to the trainer,
### since that is where the variables are populated from.
### If a movement error is detected then the script assumes you are
### inside the training room, and moves you into the room the
### variables are populated from before moving you along the
### rest of the auto-mapped path.
